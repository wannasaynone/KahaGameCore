--- Overview ---
The SpriteBlendingMode.cs script allows you to apply various blend modes to 2D sprites. 
It dynamically updates the material properties of a sprite based on the selected blend mode.

--- Usage ---

1. Attach the SpriteBlendingMode script to a GameObject with a SpriteRenderer.

2. Select a blend mode from the dropdown in the Inspector.

3. The shader will automatically update to reflect the chosen mode.

4. You can change the blend mode on runtime.


-- The script supports the following blend modes: --
- Opaque: Normal alpha blending.

- Add: Colors are added together.

- Multiply: Multiplies the sprite with the background.

- Screen: Inverts, multiplies, and inverts the colors again.

- Overlay: Combines Multiply and Screen for a dynamic effect.

- Darken: Chooses the darker of the sprite and background colors.

- Lighten: Chooses the lighter of the sprite and background colors.

- Subtract: Subtracts the sprite's color from the background.

- Hard Light Approximation: A rough approximation of the Hard Light blend.

- Soft Light Approximation: A rough approximation of the Soft Light blend.


--- How It Works ---

The script updates the sprite’s material whenever the blend mode changes. 
This is done by adjusting the shader’s blend properties (_SourceBlend, _DestinationBlend, _BlendOp).

-- Key Functions --

SetupMaterial(): Ensures the sprite has a material instance and assigns a shader.

UpdateBlendMode(): Updates the shader blend properties based on the selected blend mode.

Update(): Monitors for changes to the blend mode and updates the material when necessary.




--- Shader Details ---

The custom shader (2D_Sprite_Shader.shader) enables different blending modes by modifying the following properties:

_SourceBlend:  Defines how the source color is blended.

_DestinationBlend:  Defines how the destination color is blended.

_BlendOp:  Determines the blend operation (e.g., Add, Subtract, Darken, etc.).


-- Shader Functions--

darken(v2f i): Applies a darken blend effect.

hardLight(v2f i): Approximates the Hard Light blend.

softLight(v2f i): Approximates the Soft Light blend.


--- Editor Integration ---

A Custom Inspector is included to provide tooltips and warnings for blend mode selection. 
If an approximation mode is selected, the inspector displays a warning about its imprecision.


- Notes -

The shader must be assigned in the Shader.Find("Custom/2D_Sprite_Shader") call.

Hard Light and Soft Light are approximations and may not match traditional blending.
